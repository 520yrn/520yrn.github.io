I’m currently a student in the research-based program Master of Engineering (M.Eng) in the <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/">Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering</a> at the <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore</a> (NUS) under the supervise of Dr. <a href="https://cde.nus.edu.sg/cee/staff/kaidi-yang-2/">Kaidi Yang</a>. Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/">Southeast University</a> (SEU) in traffic engineering (Mao Yisheng Class) at the <a href="https://tc.seu.edu.cn/jt_en/"> Department of Transportation Engineering</a> and joined an exchange program held by NUS and SEU. My research interest lies in developing methods for steady transitions toward next-generation transportation systems, with a particular focus on system optimization and control. In the future, I’m glad to talk about any interesting ideas and potential collaborations.
