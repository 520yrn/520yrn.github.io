I’m currently a student of the research-based program Master of Engineering (M.Eng) in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in the National University of Singapore (NUS). Prior to this, I received my bachelor degree from Southeast University (SEU) in traffic engineering and joined an exchange program held by NUS and SEU. My research interest lies in many aspects with a particular focus on intelligent transportation systems and traffic equilibrium analysis. In the future, I’m glad to talk about any interesting ideas and potential collaborations.
