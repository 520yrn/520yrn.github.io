I am currently a Ph.D student at the Connected and Automation Transportation lab in the <a href="https://ce.gatech.edu/">School of Civil and Environmental Engineering</a> at <a href="https://www.gatech.edu/"> Georgia Institute of Technology</a> (Gatech) under the supervise of Prof. <a href="https://ce.gatech.edu/directory/person/srinivas-peeta">Srinivas-Peeta</a>. Prior to this, I received my bachelor's degree from <a href="https://www.seu.edu.cn/english/">Southeast University</a> (SEU) in traffic engineering (Mao Yisheng Class) at the <a href="https://tc.seu.edu.cn/jt_en/"> Department of Transportation Engineering</a> and my master's degree from <a href="https://nus.edu.sg/">National University of Singapore </a> (NUS). My research interest lies in developing methods for steady transitions toward next-generation transportation systems, with a particular focus on enhancing system safety and reliability. In the future, Iâ€™m glad to talk about any interesting ideas and potential collaborations.
