* Hi! I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the School of Information and Communication Engineering (SICE) in Beijing University of Post and Telecommunication (BUPT), major in Information Communication Engineering (ICE). 
* I received my B.S. degree from BUPT in 2015. 
* I have been a Visiting Researcher with the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of California, Davis, USA, and advised by Prof. [Shuguang Cui](https://faculty.engineering.ucdavis.edu/cui/). I have also been a Visiting Researcher with The Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shenzhen, China, and Shenzhen Research Institute of Big Data. 
* My research interests include machine learning, large-scale data analytics and system control, data-driven wireless network management.
