I’m currently an M.Eng student in the department of Civil and Environmental Engineering in National University of Singapore (NUS). Prior to this, I received my bachelor degree from Southeast University (SEU) in traffic engineering and joint an exchange program held by NUS and SEU. My research interest lies in many aspects with a particular focus on reinforcement learning and generative advarsarial networks. In the future, I’m glad to talk about any interesting ideas and possible collabrations.
