    <h2>Physics-Informed Digital Twin-Enhanced Reinforcement Learning in Mixed-Fleet Mobility-on-Demand Systems</h2>
    <p><b>Advisor: Dr. Kaidi Yang in the Dept. of Civil & Environmental Engineering at National University of Singapore</b>
    <p>Developed a model-free reinforcement learning method for vehicle rebalancing in mixed-autonomy mobility-on-demand systems that integrated a physics-informed digital twin to improve sample efficiency.
      This research has resulted in a research paper under review in Transportation Research Part C</p>

    <h2>Risk Evaluation and Protection of Overtaking based on Simulated Driving Experiment</h2>
    <p><b>Advisor: Prof. Yongjun Shen in the Dept. of Transportation Engineering at Southeast University</b>
    <p>Conducted state preference survey to evaluate human drivers’ subjective aggressiveness during overtaking and developed regression models to evaluate human drivers’ objective aggressiveness during overtaking based on 
data collected from simulated driving experiments.
